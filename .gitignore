#Terraform Ignore File

#ignore all JENKINS_HOME except jobs directory, root xml config, and .gitignore file
#/*
!/.gitignore
!/*.xml

#ignore all files in jobs subdirectories except for folders
#note: git doesn't track folders, only file content
#terraform/**
!terraform/

#uncomment the following line to save next build numbers with config
#!jobs/**/nextBuildNumber

#exclude only config.xml files in repository subdirectories
!config.xml

#don't track workspaces (when users build on the master)
jobs/**/*workspace

#as a result only settings and job config.xml files in JENKINS_HOME will be tracked by git
